This is some code I developed to generate lithophanes from images.  There are two jupyter notebooks you can try out. Both should work in Google Colabratory as is.  The first one is a tutorial about Lithophans and the second one is just the example code if you want to build your own lithophane.

* [Lithophane Tutorial](./Lithophane_Tutorial.ipynb)
* [Lithophane Example](./Lithophane_Example.ipynb)

You can click the open in colab link and the file should automatically open in your google colabratory account.  The following slides also describe how the code works:

I hope you find this useful.
